<ul><li>Before sign in the contest i already bein working on this project fo 10 hours.in hours one and two i researched and picked the components that i will use after that in the hours 3 and 4 i studied the datasheet of every component and for the remaining hours i started creating the firs version of the schematics</li>
<li>6/4/25 20:07-21:00 Created git hub repository and  readme file also uploaded my previous work on the project  </li>
<li> 6/4/25 21:07-22:00 started working on the pcb of the version one of the board and finished it  </li>
<li>7/4/25 11:30-13:30 started working on a more simplified version (v2) of the schematic and also the PCb because the previous one was very bulky. I had to make a lot of chanches such as removing the 3.3V regulator and also removing the connectors thaty meant that i have to reroute the circuit and also find a way to connect the boards together.I came to the conclusion that the best way to connct the boards together is with simple wires and holes.
The PCB design was a little bit chalenging because. First of all i had to to squize a lot of the components together and that meant a small space for a lot of connections, i solved it by introducing two more layers to the pcb so the connctions are more organized and have more space betwwen them . Also i had a problem with conncting the components from the top layer to the bottom but i figured it out by using VIA for this type of connctions.All in all it was a chalenging design but i managed to come through the problems and finished it  </li>
<li>7/4/25 16:05-18:00 designing the schematic and pcb of the power distribusion sytem and adding it into a pcb with the other components that i previously removed from the version of one the schematic also mid jerney of the designing i figured a problem with the output of the 3.3V regulator that i later fixed. Also started working on the charching board by researching components and readings datasheets to find the most suitable for board </li>
