<ul><li>Before sign in the contest i already bein working on this project fo 10 hours.in hours one and two i researched and picked the components that i will use after that in the hours 3 and 4 i studied the datasheet of every component and for the remaining hours i started creating the firs version of the schematics</li>
<li>4/6/25 20:07-21:00 Created git hub repository and  readme file also uploaded my previous work on the project  </li>
<li> 4/6/25 21:07-22:00 started working on the pcb of the version one of the board and finished it  </li>
<li>5/6/25 11:30-13:30 started working on a more simplified version (v2) of the schematic and also the PCb because the previous one was very bulky. I had to make a lot of chanches such as removing the 3.3V regulator and also removing the connectors thaty meant that i have to reroute the circuit and also find a way to connect the boards together.I came to the conclusion that the best way to connct the boards together is with simple wires and holes.
The PCB design was a little bit chalenging because. First of all i had to to squize a lot of the components together and that meant a small space for a lot of connections, i solved it by introducing two more layers to the pcb so the connctions are more organized and have more space betwwen them . Also i had a problem with conncting the components from the top layer to the bottom but i figured it out by using VIA for this type of connctions.All in all it was a chalenging design but i managed to come through the problems and finished it  </li>
<li>5/4/25 16:05-18:00 designing the schematic and pcb of the power distribusion sytem and adding it into a pcb with the other components that i previously removed from the version of one the schematic also mid jerney of the designing i figured a problem with the output of the 3.3V regulator that i later fixed. Also started working on the charching board by researching components and readings datasheets to find the most suitable for board ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93485102-f06c-4ef3-a052-6abdc4e44fda)</li>
<li>6/4/25 13:31-14:45 i worked to he charging station by first of all picking the parts and starting designing the first version of the schematic ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51a39ed8-5c0b-4097-8a0c-9bdb35669213)</li>
<li> 6/4/25 15:15-17:15 In this hour i finished the charging station schematic and PCB that possed a challenge as i had to find a way to limit the voltage curent that was coming from the usb-c connentor i solved this problem by inplimenting a p-fet and a control source resistor in the v-bus of the usb-c input. Also i made some changes in the power schematic of the pen more specificly i changed the previous regulator with a more smaller and more efficient one as a consequence of this i had to redisigne the pcb.In the end i deleted the previous version of the power-etc file , uiploaded the new one and the charching station schematics and pcb.
<li>9/6/25 12:20-3:20 started working on the 3d printables that presented to number of chalenges.Firt of all the 3d models were incorect and spend some time to solve this problem after that i had two main problems the dimensions and the layout of the pcbs inside the device. For the first problem i used my digital caliper and take some measurments of a regualr pen and i started designing from this, for the second problem i decided to a layout with the microcontroler and gyro on the top of the device the battery in the midle and the power/etc circuit on close to the bottom of the device so the button is more accesible.Last but not least i had a proble on how i am going to fit the pcbs on the device so i ended up spliting the case  and making some insertrs so the microcontroler and gyro can slide in and after that the case can be closed with some screws.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60db24a2-3165-4a84-9ac9-065d30f4f1f8) ,![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31b908d3-fe08-4d59-8160-99fa570f8079)
