# Stylus 
 Stylus is a pen like any other but it also records what you write.For example  if you are taking notes in a class using stylus you can synchronize it with you tablet,laptop or phone and what you write in the paper also appears in your device .
 I thought to create stylus after a test that i failed in my school because i lost my inportant notes that are on some random papers that the teacher gave us .After that i said that i am going to creaete something that will help me but also others to never 
 loose their notes.
